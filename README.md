First interactive game by Jennifer Lee - Memory Game Project 

How to play:
The game will start when you first click on a card. On the top left, there is a timer (which will show in seconds), a starboard and moves counter.  On the top right, there is a replay button. When two cards are flipped, its considered one move.  If these two cards do not match, it will flipped back over.  If they do match, they will remain open.  When all the cards are matched, there will be a Stats board that will show you the number of moves, the timer and your star rating.

My personal development:
This project has really stretched me in understanding all the concepts that I have learned so far with Udacity.  Despite how difficult it was, it help solidify my understanding in how Javascript, HTML and CSS work together. For this I am very thankful and proud. 

Acknowledgements and resources:

Iip.Udacity: on providing one to one inital help in getting started with coding event listeners and using the developmental console in Google Chrome. The one to one session was originally on the Color Picker lab using Vanilla Javascript instead of Jquery. Its amazing, 2 months ago, I wasn't sure on how to implement an event listener or work with functions well and now I completed this type of project!  Crazy!!!!!
