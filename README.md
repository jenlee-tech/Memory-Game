# Memory Game - Project 2
This is your childhood memory game on the WEB!  

## How to play:
The game will start when you first click on any card.  When you click on a card, it will flip open.  When two cards are flipped, its considered one move.  If these two cards do not match, it will flipped back over.  If they do match, they will remain open.  When all the cards are matched, a Stats board will appear, indicating the time it took for you to finish the game, the number of moves and a star rating. In addition, on the Stats board, there is a Replay button and a Cancel button.


On the top of the Memory Game board, the Stats are also shown as you progress through the game.  Moreover, there is a replay image button that can be clicked.

* Iip.Udacity: on providing one to one inital help in getting started with coding event listeners and troubleshooting with the development console in Google Chrome. The one-to-one session was originally on the Color Picker lab using Vanilla Javascript instead of Jquery. Its amazing - 2 months ago, I wasn't sure on how to implement an event listener or work with functions well and now I completed this type of project!  Crazy!!!!!

* Project Grading Rubric

* This repository contains starter code from Udacity's Memory Game Project


## My personal development:
This project has really stretched me in understanding all the concepts that I have learned so far with Udacity.  Despite how difficult it was, it help solidify my understanding on how Javascript, HTML and CSS work together. For this I am very thankful and proud.
