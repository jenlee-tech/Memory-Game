First interactive game by Jennifer Lee - Memory Game Project 

This project has really stretched me in understanding all the concepts that I have learned so far with Udacity.  Despite how difficult it was, it help solidify my understanding in how Javascript, HTML and CSS work together. For this I am very thankful and proud. 

I want to thank the following people that provide concepts and insights in helping me complete the Memory Game project:
